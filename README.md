# Jetpack Compose Components Playground

A modern Android project showcasing **all Jetpack Compose components** with a **scalable architecture** and **design best practices**.  
This playground demonstrates how to build production-ready Android apps using **Jetpack Compose**, **Kotlin**, and other **modern Android technologies**.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

This project is built as a **component playground** to explore and implement all major **Jetpack Compose UI elements**, structured with a **design system** and **clean architecture** principles.

It is designed to be:
- **Modular & Scalable**: Easy to extend with new features and components.
- **Customizable**: Supports **light/dark theme**, typography, and reusable design tokens.
- **Developer Friendly**: Follows best practices with separation of concerns, proper state management, and modern Android libraries.

## ✨ Features

- 📱 **Jetpack Compose Playground** – A catalog of Compose components with examples.
- 🎨 **Design System** – Centralized color, typography, spacing, and component guidelines.
- 🌗 **Dark/Light Theme** – Complete theme switching support.
- 🌍 **Localization** – Multi-language support using **string resources and context extensions**.
- 🏗 **Clean Architecture** – Separation of concerns across data, domain, and presentation layers.
- 🔄 **State Management** – Uses **ViewModel + StateFlow/Flow** for reactive UI updates.
- 🧪 **Scalable & Maintainable** – Built with **multi-module architecture** for future growth.
- 🛠 **Modern Kotlin Practices** – Coroutines, Flow, Extension functions, DSLs.
- 🧩 **Reusable Components** – Buttons, dialogs, inputs, layouts, and more ready for production.
